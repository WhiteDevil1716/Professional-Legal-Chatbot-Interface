# 🧑‍⚖️ AI-Powered Legal Chatbot Interface

A modern and responsive frontend for an **AI-driven legal assistant**, designed to help users ask legal questions, understand legal terminology, and generate basic legal documents. Built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**, this UI is clean, lightweight, and ready for integration with a backend model such as OpenAI or a custom legal NLP model.

## 📌 Project Overview

This interface serves as the frontend component for a **Professional Legal Chatbot System**. While the backend is expected to handle natural language understanding and legal content generation, this frontend provides an intuitive chat interface for users to interact seamlessly with the legal AI.

Whether used by law firms, legal advisors, students, or individuals, this platform can deliver legal insights at scale, reduce research time, and improve access to legal resources.
